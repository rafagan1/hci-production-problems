## ITMD 362, Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership/join page for Chicagoâ€™s Museum of Contemporary Art at
https://experience.mcachicago.org/donate/contribute1?ct=6 (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/
* Android Guidelines:
  https://developer.android.com/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2. an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL):
https://material.io/design/iconography/system-icons.html

* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
Added depicted phone icon beside Member Services number on page as the icon is more readily seen than the actual phone number. I would also change the page to only show the detailed benefits when requested.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL):

* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
https://material.io/design/color/applying-color-to-ui.html#
I would definitely add some color to the site. The links for selecting Tickets, Admissions, etc would be clearer if each had some form of background color. The site has guidelines and examples on the impact of color usage. A color palette is also provided.

* HCI Guideline Three (URL):
https://material.io/design/layout/understanding-layout.html#
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
The layout is not user friendly. It's hard to navigate on the page as the font-size is too large and the layout is not responsive. Reducing the displayed details would help.
